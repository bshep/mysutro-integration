# Home Assitant integration for mySutro Pool Sensor

## How to use

Add it using HACS

When you add the integration a window will popup where you have to put the API Token ( you will have to sniff it using mitmproxy ) copy it in and it should work

## Issues

No known issues, but this is a very simplistic implementation, i don't intend to support this so if anyone wants to continue the work they are free to copy it.
