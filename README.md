# Home Assitant integration for mySutro Pool Sensor

## How to use

- Add it using HACS

- Edit ```scripts/getToken.sh``` and replace your ```username``` and ```password``` where appropriate, run the script and copy the displayed ```token```.

- Add the integration and a window will popup where you have to put the ```token``` you copied from above.

## Issues

- No known issues, but this is a very simplistic implementation, i don't intend to support this so if anyone wants to continue the work they are free to copy it.
